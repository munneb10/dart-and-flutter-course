Question no 1:
Write a program to print sum,division,multiplication,subtraction
of 10 and 2
a) By directly using 10 and 2
b) By using variables
    ( Hint : First save number in variable and then
    perform operation also store answer in variable
    )

Question no 2:
write a program in which solve (a*a+b/2)-10 where a=10,b=20
Save answer in some variable and print it

Question no 3:
write a program to solve a^2-2ab+b^2 where a=2,b=2

Question no 4:
write a program to print remainder after dividing 35 by 2
a) By directly using 35 and 2
b) By using variables
    ( Hint : First save number in variable and then
    perform operation also store answer in variable
    )

Question no 5:
write a program to increase number by one (e.g change 3 to 4)
by using some operator
a) By using variables
    ( Hint : First save number in variable and then
    perform operation to increase by one
    )
